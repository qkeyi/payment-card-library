# Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of images and data related to various payment cards, primarily from US-based financial institutions. The collection is organized by card issuer, with each issuer having its own directory. Within each issuer's directory, there are subdirectories for different card types (e.g., Credit Card, Debit Card) and categories (e.g., Personal, Business).

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a visual and data library for payment cards. It includes:

-   **Issuers:** Indicates the card issuer.
-   **Card details:** Includes benefits, sign up bonus, annual fee, and more.
-   **Card Images:** A vast collection of credit, debit, and gift card images.
-   **Documentation:** `README.md` files within each issuer's directory provide a quick-glance view of the card images available for that issuer.
-   **Database synchronization:** `serialization` folder contains serialized data of cards, which can be used for database reference.


-   `**/README.md`: Markdown files that act as visual catalogs for the card images within their respective directories.
